# automatic-archives
This is a workflow and set of python scripts that extracts a series of URLs and their metadata from a JSON file, then caches them at the Internet Archive based on their update frequency.

The JSON URL data comes from [this repository](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/data-sources-mirror).
