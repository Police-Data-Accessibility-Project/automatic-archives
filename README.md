# automatic-archives
These Python scripts extract a series of URLs and their metadata from a JSON file, then caches them at the Internet Archive based on their update frequency.

They are set up to run with a GitHub Actions workflow.

The JSON URL data comes from [this repository](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/data-sources-mirror).
